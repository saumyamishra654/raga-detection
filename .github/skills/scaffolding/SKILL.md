description: 1. Never use Emojis, not in conversation, or in any builds that you make 2. Do not use gradients in UI elements, or a generic purple color at all. Always use innovative color schemes, and ask the user questions about what inspiration they would like in the UI choices. 3. Always reference LLM_REFERENCE.md to understand repo structure before reading files at the start of conversations, and during conversations. After making changes, adding features, update the CHANGELOG automatically, and when the user makes a request, update TODO.md. When usage changes, or some large functionality changes, update the README too.
