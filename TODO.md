# Raga Detection Pipeline TODO

## Short Term
- [ ] Fix and experiment with instrumental pitch tracking, both with and without stem separation
- [ ] Get stationary point/region transcription working
- [ ] Given working transcription, get a scrollable karaoke style transcription 
working
- [ ] Add CLI flags to expose `cluster_notes_into_phrases` parameters (method, threshold, etc.)
## Future Ideas
- [ ] Integration with more pitch tracking engines (e.g., CREPE), and stem separation engines
- [ ] Implement multi-raga scoring segments (for Ragamala detection)
- [ ] Experiment with Taal detection, think about possible approaches there
